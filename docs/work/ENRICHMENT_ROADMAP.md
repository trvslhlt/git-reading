# Data Enrichment Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach to enriching book metadata in the git-reading system.

---

## Phase 1: Basic Enrichment ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Enrich books with basic metadata from Open Library

**Implementation**: Completed in earlier sessions

**Coverage Achieved**:
- **Subjects**: ~70% of books
- **Publication Year**: ~84% of books
- **ISBN-13**: ~42% of books (after bug fix)
- **ISBN-10**: ~40-60% of books

**Key Components**:
- ✅ Open Library API client ([src/enrich/clients/openlibrary.py](../src/enrich/clients/openlibrary.py))
- ✅ Book metadata normalizer ([src/enrich/normalizers/book_normalizer.py](../src/enrich/normalizers/book_normalizer.py))
- ✅ Enrichment CLI ([src/enrich/cli.py](../src/enrich/cli.py))
- ✅ Database schema for enrichment data
- ✅ Source tracking system
- ✅ Incremental enrichment support

**Bugs Fixed**:
- ✅ ISBN fetching bug (using `cover_edition_key` instead of `edition_key`)
- ✅ Orphaned records cleanup in incremental load

---

## Phase 2: Cross-Reference Enrichment (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Link books across multiple knowledge bases for richer metadata

### 2.1 Wikidata Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**Why**: Wikidata provides structured data about books, authors, literary movements, and influences

**Data Enriched**:
- ✅ Author biographical data (birth/death dates & places, nationality, biography)
- ✅ Literary movements (with Q-ID → label resolution)
- ✅ Thematic tags and subjects (with Q-ID → label resolution)
- ✅ Awards and recognition
- ✅ Wikipedia URLs and VIAF IDs
- ✅ Author influence relationships (who influenced whom)
- ⏳ Translations and editions (schema ready, not yet implemented)

**Implementation Highlights**:
1. ✅ Wikidata SPARQL API client with rate limiting
2. ✅ Q-ID label resolution with batch API calls and caching
3. ✅ Book and author enrichment workflows
4. ✅ Literary movements and awards database storage
5. ✅ Integrated CLI with `--entity-type` support

**Files Created/Updated**:
- [src/enrich/clients/wikidata.py](../src/enrich/clients/wikidata.py) - SPARQL API client
- [src/enrich/clients/wikidata_label_resolver.py](../src/enrich/clients/wikidata_label_resolver.py) - Q-ID to label resolution
- [src/enrich/normalizers/wikidata_normalizer.py](../src/enrich/normalizers/wikidata_normalizer.py) - Data normalizers with Q-ID resolution
- [src/enrich/orchestrator.py](../src/enrich/orchestrator.py) - Author enrichment workflow
- [tests/enrich/test_wikidata_normalizer.py](../tests/enrich/test_wikidata_normalizer.py) - Unit tests

**Usage**:
```bash
# Enrich books from both sources
enrich-db enrich --sources openlibrary wikidata --limit 10

# Enrich authors only (Wikidata)
enrich-db enrich --sources wikidata --entity-type authors --limit 5

# Enrich both books and authors (Wikidata)
enrich-db enrich --sources wikidata --entity-type both --limit 10

# Via Makefile
make run-enrich ARGS='--sources wikidata --entity-type both --limit 5'
```

**Key Features**:
- **Q-ID Resolution**: Automatic conversion of Wikidata Q-IDs to human-readable labels
  - Example: "Q84" → "London", "Q24925" → "Science fiction"
  - Batch resolution (up to 50 Q-IDs per API call)
  - In-memory caching to minimize API requests
- **Author Enrichment**: Birth/death dates, places, nationality, biography, movements, influences
- **Literary Movements**: Stored for both books and authors with source tracking
- **Awards**: Book awards captured and stored in dedicated tables
- **Author Influences**: Bidirectional influence relationships (who influenced whom)
  - Automatically creates minimal author records for influencers not yet in database
  - Enables building literary genealogy graphs

**Database Impact**:
- ✅ Uses `wikidata_id` fields in `books` and `authors` tables
- ✅ `book_subjects` with source='wikidata' (with resolved labels)
- ✅ `literary_movements` table populated
- ✅ `book_movements` and `author_movements` tables populated
- ✅ `awards` and `book_awards` tables populated
- ✅ `author_influences` table populated (bidirectional relationships)

### 2.2 WorldCat/Library of Congress

**Why**: Authoritative library data, especially for older works

**Data to Fetch**:
- Authoritative author names (standardization)
- Dewey/LC classifications
- Physical descriptions
- Alternative titles

### 2.3 Google Books API

**Why**: Book previews, full-text search, popular passages

**Data to Fetch**:
- Book descriptions (often more detailed than Open Library)
- Preview availability
- Popular passages/quotes
- Related books

## Phase 3: Derived Data & Analytics (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Generate insights from enriched data

**Detailed Documentation**: See [PHASE_3_ANALYTICS.md](PHASE_3_ANALYTICS.md)

### 3.1 Author Networks ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed 2025-12-29

- ✅ Built interactive Streamlit page for exploring influence relationships
- ✅ Network overview with statistics (476 authors, 490 relationships)
- ✅ Most influential/influenced author rankings
- ✅ Filter by selected authors and their connections
- ✅ Display biographical data and influence details

**Files Created**:
- `streamlit_app/pages/4_🕸️_Author_Network.py`

**Future Enhancement**: Replace table view with interactive graph visualization (pyvis/networkx)

### 3.2 Thematic Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed 2025-12-29

- ✅ Subject distribution with bar charts and filtering
- ✅ Literary movement analysis with timelines
- ✅ Subject co-occurrence analysis
- ✅ Interactive book/author explorers by subject/movement
- ✅ Source tracking (Open Library vs Wikidata)

**Files Created**:
- `streamlit_app/pages/5_📚_Thematic_Analysis.py`

### 3.3 Reading Statistics ✅ COMPLETED

**Status**: Completed 2025-12-29

- ✅ Temporal reading patterns (year/quarter/month)
- ✅ Reading velocity metrics
- ✅ Author demographics (nationality, lifespan)
- ✅ Publication era analysis (by century and decade)
- ✅ Book age when read analysis
- ✅ Books per author statistics
- ✅ Awards analysis

**Files Created**:

## Phase 4: Enhanced Search (FUTURE)

**Goal**: Use enriched metadata to improve search capabilities

### 4.1 Metadata-Enhanced Search

- Search by literary movement
- Find books by author influences
- Filter by publication era
- Subject-based recommendations

### 4.2 Graph-Based Discovery

- "Books similar to X" based on metadata
- "Authors influenced by Y"
- "Books in the same movement"

---

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Priority: High

1. **Incremental Enrichment Optimization**
   - Batch API requests to reduce latency
   - Implement rate limiting and retry logic
   - Cache API responses

2. **Data Quality**
   - Confidence scores for enriched data
   - Conflict resolution when sources disagree
   - Data validation and cleanup

### Priority: Medium

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Track enrichment success rates
   - Alert on API failures
   - Dashboard for enrichment coverage

4. **Testing**
   - Integration tests for API clients
   - Mock API responses for unit tests
   - Test coverage for edge cases

### Priority: Low

5. **Performance**
   - Parallel enrichment of multiple books
   - Async API calls
   - Database query optimization

---

## Decision Points

### Should We Proceed with Phase 2?

**Questions to consider**:
1. Is current enrichment coverage sufficient for your use case?
2. Do you need biographical data about authors?
3. Would cross-referencing with Wikidata add value?
4. Are there specific metadata gaps you want to fill?

**Estimated Effort**:
- Phase 2.1 (Wikidata): ~3-5 days
- Phase 2.2 (WorldCat): ~2-3 days
- Phase 2.3 (Google Books): ~2-3 days

### Alternative Priorities

Instead of Phase 2 enrichment, you might prioritize:
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Visualize current enriched data
- **Advanced Search**: Use existing metadata for better discovery
- **Export Features**: Generate reading lists, citations, etc.
- **Integration**: Connect to other tools (Goodreads, LibraryThing)

---

## Next Steps

**To continue with Phase 2**:
1. Choose which data source to integrate first (recommend Wikidata)
2. Review database schema additions
3. Design API client and normalization strategy
4. Implement incremental enrichment workflow
5. Test on subset of books
6. Roll out to full database

**To explore alternatives**:
1. Review current enrichment coverage with `make run-enrich-status`
2. Identify specific metadata needs
3. Prioritize based on value vs. effort
4. Create focused implementation plan
